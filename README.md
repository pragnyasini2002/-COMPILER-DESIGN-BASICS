# Project Overview: COMPILER DESIGN BASICS

# Objective:
To understand and implement the foundational components of a compiler using the C programming language. This project focuses on building a simple compiler or interpreter that demonstrates key phases like lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code generation for a subset of a programming language.

# Scope:
Implement a basic compiler for a simplified version of a programming language (e.g., arithmetic expressions or mini-C).

Focus on the initial stages of compilation: lexical analysis, parsing, and optionally intermediate code generation.

Understand symbol tables, tokens, grammars, and error handling.

# Key Components of the Compiler:
Lexical Analyzer (Lexer)

Tokenizes the input source code.

Identifies keywords, operators, identifiers, literals, and separators.

Uses techniques like finite automata or regular expressions.

Error Handling Module:

Detects lexical or syntactic errors and reports them meaningfully.
# Tools and Technologies:
Language: C

Compiler: GCC 

IDE: Code:: VSÂ Code
